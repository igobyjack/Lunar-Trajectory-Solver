# Lunar Trajectory Solver

Using the General Mission Analysis Tool (GMAT) to determine the optimal launch time for a lunar transfer. The script scans through various delta-V values, coast times, and start epochs to find the best solution that minimizes the distance to the moon.

I built this to become more familiar with GMAT, a tool to simulate spacecraft trajectories/orbits, and its Python API.
